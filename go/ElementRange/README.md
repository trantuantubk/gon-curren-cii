# Finding the Range of Elements with a Certain Value in a Sorted Array

## Motivation and Inspiration

On March 5, 2023, I solved Leetcode problem number 34, "**Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**" using different approaches and implemented solutions in three programming languages: C++, Python3, and Go. After completing the solution with the "*finding lower-bound*" approach, I looked at the solutions written in Go and found **Ajay_74**'s implementation that used Goroutines and Channels with two separate functions to find the first and last occurrences of the element, respectively. This inspired me to write a concurrent implementation of the problem for the "*finding lower-bound*" approach.
